# Nstyle Design System
**Problem**: Inconsistent UI across products slowed delivery.  
**Approach**: Asset inventory → tokens → component library → governance.  
**Outcome**: Faster delivery, higher consistency, documented patterns.

## My Role
Led tokens, core components, documentation, rollout plan.

## Evidence
- Engineering PR velocity improved (internal metrics)
- Fewer design QA defects reported post-launch
