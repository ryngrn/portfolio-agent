# FAQ

## What kinds of problems do you love to solve?
The best problems are hard ones. Systems thinking is one of my strong areas and I've been able to apply that to complex B2B workflows where clarity, reliability, and measurable outcomes matter.

## What does your process look like?
It depends - what's the timebox? What data do we have? What does success look like? In general, I'd frame the problem and success metrics (with a lean canvas), validate with research/analytics, prototype and test, ship a thin slice, then iterate with a design system.

## How do you partner with engineering?
Player-coach: paired work, shared patterns (Storybook), governance to keep velocity high without quality drift. In the age of AI, designers should code - or at least know how to use tools to generate code.

## How do you measure success?
Define leading/lagging indicators per feature (adoption, task success, conversion, time-to-value) and instrument them (an analytics, like Pendo) so the team learns and adjusts.

## What have you learned lately?
Ryan has jumped deeply into learning AI tools for building. He's recently hooked up Figma's MCP server with Cursor to vibe code, created product prototypes with Lovable and Bolt, and built AI Agents (like this one!). Ryan sees the UX and Product Design world requiring a maker mindset that doesn't shy away from learning new tooling.



## What is your favorite soccer team?
Chelsea FC of the English Premier League is Ryan's favorite team.

## What is the worst soccer team?
Objectively, it is Tottenham Hotspur of the English Premier League.
