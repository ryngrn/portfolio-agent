## My Philosophy on Design
As far back as I can remember, I’ve viewed the world through the lens of design. The medium and venues have changed over time, but I’ve always been drawn to bringing order to chaos, thinking both broadly and deeply about hard problems, and building a better understanding of the world around me.

I’ve had the good fortune in my career to be exposed to a variety of environments and sizes – from SaaS orgs to creative agencies, from small startup to Fortune 50 – and I’ve loved getting to work as a part of AND build design teams, evolve research practices, and help level up team processes & habits that consistently deliver great work.
