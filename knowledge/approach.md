# Product & Design Approach

## Principles
- Outcomes first: define the problem, success metrics, and the smallest valuable slice to ship.
- Evidence wins: pair qualitative research with behavioral analytics; test assumptions early.
- System over heroics: design systems, shared conventions, and governance unlock velocity.
- Collaboration: PM/Design/Eng alignment, player-coach modeling, and regular demos.

## How I work
1) Frame the problem (JTBD, constraints, risks)  
2) Map users & journeys; validate with interviews/analytics  
3) Prototype & test (usability or in-product A/B)  
4) Ship a thin slice; measure; iterate with guardrails  
5) Document decisions; fold learnings into the system

## What changes with scale
- Org design and leveling frameworks for designers
- Shared research practice + instrumentation (e.g., Pendo, FullStory)
- Design system governance and documentation (Figma + Storybook)
